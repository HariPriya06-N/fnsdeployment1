        <h1>Case Study: Personal Portfolio Website</h1>

        <h2>Project Overview:</h2>
        <p>I developed a responsive personal portfolio website to showcase my projects, skills, and contact information. It was designed to be clean, simple, and professional, with easy navigation and smooth user experience.</p>

        <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
        <p>I needed an online presence to share my projects, resume, and skills with recruiters or anyone interested in my work.</p>

        <h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML5</li>
            <li>CSS3 (Flexbox, Media Queries)</li>
            <li>Font Awesome</li>
            <li>GitHub for version control</li>
            <li>Netlify for deployment</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What I Did:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Structured the layout with HTML.</li>
            <li>Styled the design using CSS for responsiveness and visual clarity.</li>
            <li>Integrated social media icons using Font Awesome.</li>
            <li>Hosted the website live using Netlify.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges Faced:</h2>
        <p>Making the design fully responsive for different screen sizes and ensuring cross-browser compatibility was initially challenging.</p>

        <h2>Outcomes:</h2>
        <p>The final website is a clean, responsive, and functional portfolio that presents my skills and work clearly. This project improved my confidence in frontend development and deployment.</p>
